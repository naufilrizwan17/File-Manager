# File-Manager
This project is a modern and straightforward attempt to sort out your desktop, remove the trash files, maintain a check-in-balance of all files copied and removed as well as establishing a productive work environment.
It is my version of a mini-File Explorer which performs the basic operations and can help developers use these ideas to create their own magic!
